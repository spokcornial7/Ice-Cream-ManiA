<html>Welcome to Ice Cream Mania!<BR><BR>Game Mode: Timed<BR><BR>The goal of the game is to stack as many ice cream scoops as possible within 70 seconds. Follow the diagram on the right, displaying the flavor of scoop to be added. If you stack the wrong scoop on top, three of your scoops will be taken off the stack. If you stack a bomb (the black circle), you immediately lose the game. Use your left and right arrow keys to move your ice cream cone. Beware! The game gets faster every 10 seconds.<BR><BR>Good luck and have fun!<BR><BR><BR> *Hint: Keep your ice cream as straight as possible*</html>
